1. This is another practice site with three main elements/divs and some relative positioning practice. 
2. Had to take a two week break in the middle.  Picked up with no issue. However, SASS plug-in for Visual Studio Code still not working.
3. Finished it up this morning. Had to rework some last child statements from what he taught since SASS not working. Used Gap in flexbox instead of margins and last child, shaved off 4 lines of code. 
4. Spent all day improving the finished example site. Gary does an amazing job in a short tutorial timeframe, but it was a lot of fun tweaking the site to make it look better. Got rid of a horizontal scroll bar at mid screen sizes, adding/subtracted padding and whitespace in several spots and at different screen sizes, and also improved the layout of the carousal cards and the purple line text decoration item as well. Now the site is more responsive and detailed. Still would like to change the grid order for large phone sizes to alternate company icons, but need to look into that more.
