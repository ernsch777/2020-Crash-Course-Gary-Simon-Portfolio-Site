This is another practice site with three main elements/divs and some relative positioning practice. 
Had to take a two week break in the middle.  Picked up with no issue. However, SASS plug-in for Visual Studio Code still not working.
Finished it up this morning. Had to rework some last child statments from what he taught since SASS not working. Used Gap in flexbox instead of margins and last child, shaved off 4 lines of code.
